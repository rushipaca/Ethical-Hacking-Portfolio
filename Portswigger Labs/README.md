This repository contains my hands-on practice and solutions for PortSwigger Web Security Academy Labs. The goal is to deepen my understanding of web application security by learning how to exploit various server-side vulnerabilities. 

The labs cover different categories of web security, including but not limited to:

SQL Injection (SQLi) - Extracting sensitive data, bypassing authentication, and modifying database queries.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Exploiting client-side vulnerabilities to execute malicious scripts.

Authentication Vulnerabilities - Breaking weak authentication mechanisms.

Access Control Issues - Bypassing restrictions and escalating privileges.

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - Exploiting insecure server-side requests.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - Forcing users to perform unintended actions.

File Upload Vulnerabilities - Bypassing validation to execute malicious files.

Operating System (OS) Command Injection - Executing OS commands on the server that is running an application.

Each vulnerablity folder contains a writeup of each lab along with a "proof" folder which has screenshots of the Burp Suite application and completion of the lab.
